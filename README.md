Create a simple application to let users add/remove/edit tasks.
Tasks should have: title, deadline, status
![task-list](task_list.png)
![add-task](add_task.png)
![edit-task](edit_task.png)

## Requirements

- `Title` should be unique
- `Status` is one of 3 options : `["not started", "in progress", "done"]`
- Form to add/edit tasks should be opened/closed by clicking on a button (see the screenshot)
- Deploy your project to github page and provide link to your live server in README. Make sure your README file is informative and codes are well-formatted
- Only minimum style (with SASS) is needed.
